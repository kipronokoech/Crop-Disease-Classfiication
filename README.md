# Crop-Disease-Classfiication
This is classification problem applied to Agriculture. 
This project was presented as a solution to a Zindi
Challenge and ranked as top 15% solution.

## Abstract
The objective of this project is to build a machine 
learning algorithm to correctly classify if a 
plant (wheat) is healthy, has stem rust, or has 
leaf rust.

## Data
876 images to train the model on 
and 610 images used to test it. Some images 
may contain both stem and leaf rust, but there is 
always one type of rust that is more dominant 
than the other, i.e. you will not find images 
where both appear equally. The goal is to classify 
the image according to the type of wheat rust that 


Unfortunately, Zindi reserves the ownership of the data 
and as such the data may not be published here.
A work around, however, is to get the data from the challenge
page [link](https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease)
.
